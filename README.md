# vim_Config
My vim settings

### Warning
+ This repo is mostly abandoned from now on, since I started using [NixVim](https://github.com/antoniodrumond/nixvim). I still use classic Vim for a few tasks, with a more minimal config, without plugins. The ``.vimrc`` I still use and update can be found in [this](https://github.com/antoniodrumond/flake) repo, with the rest of my system dotfiles
